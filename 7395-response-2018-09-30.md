## Response: 'Perspectives on the CAP Theorem'

### Summary
The paper is primarily focused on explaining the concept of CAP theorem and how it can be applied to a distributed computing environment. The authors redefine CAP which stands for consistency, availability and partition tolerance as “the impossibility of guaranteeing both safety and liveness in an unreliable distributed system. Consistency is considered to be a “classic safety property” which ensures that every response received by the clients is correct and availability is considered to be a “classic liveness property” which implies that every request will receive a response. Unreliable distributed environment not only encompasses partition tolerance but various other system failures that might happen like crash failures, message loss or malicious attacks. From an implementation point of view, distributed systems try to compromise consistency or availability or both depending upon the requirements of the application in consideration.

The authors referred to the concept of consensus where each process begins with some initial value and all the processes have to agree on one of those values. There are three requirements of these consensus systems: agreement, validity, and termination. Such consensus systems can be used for building reliably distributed environments, where availability is improved by replicating service on multiple servers and consistency, is maintained via servers agreeing on the order of updates to the service. Since developing a perfect distributed system which assures that CAP is achievable is kind of impossible until now, so the authors discuss the trade-offs like “how many faults can be tolerated?” or “what level of network reliability is needed to achieve both consistency and availability?”. Researchers explored the concept of “network synchrony” to answer that how much reliability is needed to solve consensus. A synchronous network is such where all process has clocks and they are synchronized, every message is delivered within a fixed and known amount of time and every process takes steps at a fixed rate. But achieving such perfect synchrony is impossible in real-time systems.

Next, the authors discuss various kinds of partitioning schemes. As different types of data require varying levels of consistency and availability, so data partitioning is one of the approaches. Second is operation partitioning in which an application can be partitioned on the basis of operational dimension. The third is functional partitioning where services are divided into sub-services which have varying requirements and finally user partitioning where network performance is correlated to the real geographical distance.
### What’s one thing I learned?
Consensus-based systems and Network Synchrony were new concepts that I learned related to CAP trade-off.
### What’s something I didn’t understand?

Consensus-based systems are just introduced in the paper. So, wanted to know how exactly consensus-based systems work internally?
### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
1.  There are many non-relational databases like HBase, Aerospike, and Cassandra which have a consistency tuning parameter. How exactly availability is hyper tuned for such databases?
2.  How data replication is done in distributed systems where the network is partitioned geographically?
### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
1.  Getting into the details of the functioning of non-relational databases.
2.  Understanding how exactly networks are partitioned and what all schemes are there for data replication.
